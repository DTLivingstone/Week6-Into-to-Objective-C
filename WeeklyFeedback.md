##WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
Concentrating on my own project was more challenging and also more rewarding. Learned better work habits, ie staying focused and getting code to work vs endlessly tweaking.

During project week the teacher and TAs were all extremely helpful.

I like project week. I much prefer the self paced learning and the ability to focus on whatever I need to focus on to accomplish what I'm trying to accomplish. I have way more fun messing around with layouts and color schemes and app design when I'm not trying to cram everything in during a class/lab day, and definitely feel like I learned a lot at a fast pace this week. I'm glad we have a project week in the middle of this course, it got me really motivated for the second half.

Lots of good help and instructor availability during project week

I enjoyed the project week a lot. I had a great chance to apply the knowledge of Swift and its frameworks in the process of developing my own application. Also, it was a good debugging session.

Project week stretch with Heidi!!

This week was all project week. So not surprisingly the instructors and TAs were very valuable during this process. And google.

It was project week -- everything is helpful and a lot of the course material comes together during this time.

Everyone I ask for help offered good advice, and either an instructor or a TA checked in with me every day of the week.

Not much to report this week. Mostly just working on our projects which I found to be a very valuable experience overall.

Continued focus on outlining what we are going to learn, teaching it, reviewing it. I think separating storyboard / Xcode portion from coding. re: Project Week. - this was a great way to find out what information was missing & what its like to start on your own from scratch vs. following lecture/lab. - getting early start on Project week was good, though it cut our lecture/learning time short.

##WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

I feel like I got off to a confusing start. I didn't really know where to attack to even get started on the first day, and had to get reoriented and lost a whole day. I definitely feel like it would be a big benefit if the instructors focused during our one on one app discussions on where to START. I definitely saw that as a common problem on day one. Once everybody got a toe hold, people started cranking away, but there was a lot of disoriented confusion on day one as people were trying to figure out where to start.

It was project week so it was all me all the time.

I guess the day off hindered some progress, but what can you do.

I'm not sure it's helpful to push app store ready status by the end of one week. As soon as I started treating my project as a rapid prototype exercise that allowed me to understand what the problem I was solving even was, I got over making sure it was perfect for the app store and learned something. Now, I know what I need to know to write it again!

I can't think of anything that was unhelpful, because I was mostly independent but I got help when I asked.

I still think it would be interesting to explicitly hear and/or discuss why we are learning what we are learning each week - the rationale behind the specific curriculum we are working with. We get the what, but not always the why. Like this is a design pattern you will see over and over, etc. I'm not sure which week this survey is for as I think I missed the previous one. So comments for this past week and 2 weeks ago. re: Project Week. - Here are some "gaps" that I noticed jumping in to my own project. - 5 minute background on different app styles in Xcode would be useful. - some overview of all the different frameworks / services / etc. - I think a mini-boot camp on creating an app from start to finish would be a worthwhile thing for the thursday prior to project week. Xcode new project, a view controller or two, maybe brief exposure to tab controller, creating icons & assets for your app (tools, workflow, etc.) - data modeling patterns & strategies - some more lecture content on the different storage apis / document storage - local vs cloud etc. and how/where they can be used. - 30 minute high-level overview of the n common app design paradigms, touching on the HIG, etc.

##DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

I'm not sure I understand the teaching style. The in-class coding, then going to write the same exact code in lab, seems like a waste of time. Half the class is taking notes, half the class is live coding along with the instructor, when we get to lab some of the folks are already just about done, others are just getting started. If we're going to be writing live code in class, why not just have everybody code along, and then do a second project similar in lab? We're halfway there already, and I feel like the engagement of the class would significantly improve if everybody was following along. It just seems to me that the more you can get your fingers on a keyboard and type along with the tutorials the better off you are, and it feels like a wasted opportunity to have a class of people just watching at best... zoning out or surfing Facebook at worst. And there are definitely people in this class who get lost and are not vocal enough to speak up about it.

I'm excited for objective c.

I think I would very much enjoy a one on one to find out how I am doing in this class right now. Project presentations gave me some idea as to where I may stand in the class, but this is from my own personal perspective. I'd like to know if the work I'm producing is good or not and where I can improve. I need some constructive and candid feedback from our instructors.

I'm wondering if developing two apps is necessary...it seems like it would be better to have one amazing app that we work on throughout the course than two less developed ideas. Also, I'd like to learn iOS test driven development practices please!

Its great to see the 301 and other instructors mixing it up with 201 and trying to rationalize the curriculum. Would like to see some of the same with iOS 401. Probably mostly around common pitfalls transitioning from javascript and the editor/browser development environment to IDE style dev. Just to make it seem like a more natural continuum. The 201 projects this time looked really great, thought they were 301! I think great that they were allowed to use APIs etc.
